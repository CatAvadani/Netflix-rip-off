## Description

The Netflix Rip Off is an assignment project at Medieinstitutet, designed to replicate the core functionalities of a movie platform like Netflix. The project is intended to practice and showcase not only our technical skills but also to cultivate an agile development mindset.

As part of the assignment, we've integrated advanced development practices, including the use of GitHub Actions, ESLint, and defined workflows, to ensure the project adheres to professional standards of code quality and collaboration.
